# Welcome to Image Analysis and Data Processing in Super-Resolution Microscopy


The workshop, "Image analysis and data processing in the super-resolution microscopy", is a comprehensive program that covers the principles, methods, and practical applications of super-resolution microscopy. The workshop is taking place at the VMCF Microscopy Center in Praha 2, Czech Republic. The program features talks on topics such as super-resolution microscopy methods, image processing, and data management, as well as hands-on sessions using ThunderSTORM and Fiji/ImageJ software. The program includes guest lectures for both lectures and hands-on parts. The coffee break and refreshments are included, and there will also be an informal discussion at the Academic Club.

We try every year to organize a workshop that includes both open-source and proprietary software and approaches. We aim for accessibility for anyone in the world - so we stream as much content as possible.

From 2023 the workshop has support from [Czech BioImaging](http://www.czech-bioimaging.cz/) research infrastructure and the [CzechBIAS](https://czechbias.github.io/) BioImage Analysis society.
